🧠 Project Prompt: SwapShikshak – A Mutual Transfer Platform for Government Teachers
🎯 Problem:
In states like Bihar, government school teachers are often posted far from their hometowns. Although mutual transfer is allowed, teachers have to find swap partners manually, often through WhatsApp groups or word of mouth. This is inefficient, time-consuming, and frustrating.

✅ Objective:
Build a web-based platform where government teachers can:

Register and list their transfer preferences.

Find other teachers who are interested in a mutual transfer.

Also see nearby teachers if no perfect match exists.

Contact each other securely for initiating transfers.

💡 Features Overview
🧾 1. User Registration/Login
Register as a teacher with:

Name

Subject & grade

Current school (with district & location)

Home district

Willing-to-transfer districts

Contact info (phone/email)

Privacy option (hide contact until mutual match)

🔍 2. Mutual Match Finder
Show list of teachers who want:

To come to your current school or district

And whose current school is in your preferred districts

These are two-way perfect matches.

📍 3. Nearby Teachers Feature
Even if there’s no perfect mutual match, show teachers:

Who are currently posted near your home district (within 50–100 km)

Or whose current posting is closer to your home than yours is

📥 4. Requests and Contact
A teacher can send a request to connect

If both teachers accept → contact info is revealed

Optional: in-app messaging

🛠️ 5. Teacher Dashboard
View:

Profile

Incoming/Outgoing requests

Saved matches

Nearby teachers list

🧠 6. Smart Matching Logic
Use geographical coordinates for schools/districts

Implement Haversine formula to calculate distances

Teachers can set max distance preference (e.g. "Show teachers within 100 km")
